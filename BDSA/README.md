## DISCLAIMER

### Microsoft-Magic
I use the term *Microsoft-Magic* when I refer to something that feels kind of *hacky* or is abstracted so much away by language syntax or the compiler that I actually think it can be detrimental to the developer experience.

Now you know.

### Stuff that is left out
I may intentionally skip blocks of stuff that I feel so comfortable in that I left it out in my notes. These notes are strictly to improve my learning and thus won't be complete or work as useable learning materials.
