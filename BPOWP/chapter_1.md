# IT Design

> Participatory IT Design, chapter 1

## What IT Design is

IT Design are the initial efforts of analysis and design that form the basis for deciding which of some outlined visions for future IT usage best meet business goals and user needs.

### IT Design project

A project conducted at a company that reveals goals, defines problems and indicates solutions, with the aim of designing sustainable uses of IT based on a specific problem within the company.

**An IT design project will produce a foundation for deciding whether to undertake an implementation or not**.

#### Activities in an IT Design project

- Analyzing the company's business and IT strategies, as well as its present goals, needs and potentials.

- Designing one or more visions for overall change.

- Weighing the design visions in relation to the company's business and IT strategies in relation to different personnel groups, interdepartmental relations and with regard to customers and suppliers. (*"How does this fit within the larger scope of things"*)

- Setting down a strategy and plan for technical and organizational implementation, and developing cost estimates for implementing the visions.

- Guaranteeing continued feedback from the relevant actors.

### IT Designer

A person with competencies in IT design projects and IT in general who, in cooperation with a company, plans and conducts a design project.

## MUST

### Characteristics of MUST

1. It takes a broad view of IT usage. IT-systems are viewed within the work organization context of which they will be part. What new qualifications will be required for users to contribute to desired changes are considered.

2. Extensive participation of people from the company (management, future users of the new IT system, internal IT designers who will be participating in the implementation, etc).

3. It doesn't take for granted a company's premise for a design project or any ready-solution proposals.

### Why is a design project undertaken

A Design project is undertaken because:

- Management wishes to pursue certain business goals

- One or more groups within the company have experienced a problem

- Somebody has a relatively clear idea of how a problem or new tasks can be handled with the help of new uses of IT.

### The result of an IT Design Project

The result is a **report**, possibly supplemented by prototypes, outlining one or more coherent visions for change in terms of technology, work organization and required employee qualifications.

### IT Design Project report

Includes:

- An evaluation of the effects of implementing the visions
- A cost estimate
- A strategy and plan for implementing the visions

It is through the lense of this report that a decision about an implementation project is taken.

### Conduction of an IT project

The *implementation project* is conducted by the chosen supplier.
This will often by an external company, but may in some cases be a partner or a subsidiary of a big corporation. It may even be the company's own internal IT department.

### Assessing the results of an IT project

To assess the results of an IT project, compare the design project's documented visions with the company's newly realized situation.

Do this during or after (or both) the implementation project.
