## Lecture focus

We must be able to review and clarify a company's business strategy based on an understanding of it's environment:

- Competition
- Supply chain players & stake holders
- Trends that may impact the company's business model

To do this, we look at the available information and ask questions.

## External environment

is, for example:

- Competitors
- Users
- etc

*Not* the physical surroundings in which the employees will perform the work.

### Why the external environment is important for an IT design project

Because we can learn from, for example, the competitors. Also how we can stand on top of them, but do even better.
It has to at least provide the same amount of value, preferably more.

Also, of course we have to understand our users.

## Competitors

Three kinds of competitors:

### Incumbents (traditional competitors)

Traditional competitors. You know about them.

#### What to ask about competitors

- Who are they?
- Which of them are dominant players?
- For each, investigate:
	 - Main offer (value proposition)
	 - Target segments
	 - Revenue streams
	 - Cost structure
	 - Influence on our company's target segments and revenue
- Their competitive advantages and disadvantages?
- Switching costs

### Insurgents (New entrants)

New players on the field. Easier in some industries than others.
Or, the *barrier of entry* is lower for, for example, IT companies than, for example, new airline companies (due to the amazing cost).

#### What to ask about new entrants

Basically the same as for competitors.

### Substitute products and services

Products or services that provides the same benefits, but not necessarily by the same means.
Essentially a competitor since the products are chosen to provide the same benefits/gains as your own company.

#### What to ask about substitute products and services

- Which products or services could *replace* the company's? (Also from other markets and industries)
- For each **relevant** substitute:
	 - Main offer (value proposition)
	 - Target segments
	 - Revenue streams
	 - Cost structure
	 - Influence on our company's target segments and revenue
- Their competitive advantages and disadvantages?
- Switching costs

## The relevance of understanding a company's supply chain when doing an IT project

You may not have data about the company's external partners or access to their employees.
This is effectively holes in the "full picture".

## Stakeholders

Anybody who can influence the company's situation - and is (normally) not directly part of the supply chain.

## Trends

Don't include much of it in any deliverable unless you feel confident that you are really great at it.
Also goes for SWOT.

We care about: *"Can we identify something that has changed or is about to change in the future that will have an impact on an IT project"*.

One tool for identifying these changes is called PESTLE.

Ask the company: *"Is there something that has recently changed or is about to change that may be relevant to know for this IT project?"*.

### PESTLE

A tool for estimating the impact of **relevant** business environment factors.

- Political
	 - "The government wants 95% of people to have an education"
- Economic
	 - Konjukterer, f.eks.
- Social
	 - Anything socially, culturally, that have an influence on the success of the product and service
- Technology
	 - Technological movements. New technology may render old technology obsolete
- Legal
	 - What are the legal restrictions?
- Environmental
	 - Competitors, etc. Changes in supply chain (technology shifts, etc).

Also ask: *"so what?"* for each and every impact you identify with the company.

**Always** write *"so what"*'s for each of those.
