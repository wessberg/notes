## How are they organized

- By function
- By geography
- By business area
- Wo are the managers?
- How is success measured for each organizational unit (KPIs)?

## Correlation between interview-plan and project group members

- Include people representing different interests
- Make sure to return and ask for more. The picture changes often, especially as you talk with different people.

## Scope

### Business scope

- Which aspects of the problem are included - and which aren't
- Which parts of the organization are included.
- Which work domains are included - and which aren't.

Make sure to be clear about the scope of a project. Potentially you can present multiple variations of scope (in different pricing/complexity levels).
Also, it may not be the entire organization that are part of an IT project. Only those that it is relevant to are part of the scope and should be part of
meetings, etc.
