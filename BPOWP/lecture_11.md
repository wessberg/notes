## Business goals

The purposes of the business goals are:

- Explaining to the supplier what the customer wants to achieve.
- They serve as critical factors for the customer's choice of solution.
- They help the customer control that all critical factors have been taken into account.

**Goals should be measurable!**.

It needs to be such that you can measure whether or not a goal has been reached.

Otherwise, you may reach the goal in terms of functionality, but not in terms of producing business value.
