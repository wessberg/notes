## Main points of the Agile Manifesto

Here's the main points:

1. **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools.

2. **Working software** over comprehensive documentation.

3. **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation.

4. **Responding to change** over following a plan.

While there is value in the items to the right, the items on the left are valued more.

## Principles of Agile

- Satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.

- Welcome changing requirements. Harness change for the customers competitive advantage.

- Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months - with a preference to the shorter timescale.

- Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.

- Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need and trust them to get the job done.

- The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.

- Working software is the primary measure of progress.

- Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

- Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.

- Simplicity - the art of maximizing the amount of work not done - is essential.

- The best architectures, requirements and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.

- At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

## User stories

A term coming from XP. A user story is a short, simple description of a feature **told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability**. This would most likely, at least preferably be the customer of the system. 

**This user-centric approach makes sure that we always focus on what the user wants to have, not what the user wants the system to do**.

### The form of a user story

*As a <type of user>, I want to <perform some task>, so that I can <achieve some goal>*.

### Who can write a user story

Anyone can write a user story!

### Why user stories

The user story clearly describes the goal or benefit the user is trying to achieve through it.

## Epics

An *Epic* is a **large user story**. It will later by decomposed into smaller stories that fit more readily into a single iteration.
