# Chapter 11 - Managing people and organizing teams

> [SPM] Chapter 11

## Understanding behavior

Organizational behavior (OB) is a field of social science that helps a lot here.

### Organizational Behavior (OB)

This field tends to be structured: "If A is the situation, then B is likely to result". **We observe behavior and the statistical relationship between the two variables**.

### Taylorism

This is based on Frederick Taylor's method:

Study the way that manual workers does tasks. Find the most productive way of doing those tasks. Then train workers to do the work in that way.

Three objectives of Taylorism:

- Select the best person for the job
- Instruct such people in the best methods
- Give incentives in the form of higher wages to the best workers.

What some Organizational Behavior researchers found was that the thing that increased productivity was the fact that the workers knew they were being monitored.

From all of this, two theories or attitudes have developed, Theory X and Theory Y.

### Theory X

Theory X holds that:

- The average human has a dislike of work.
- Therefore, there is need for coercion, direction and control.
- People tend to avoid responsibility.

### Theory Y

Theory Y holds that:

- Work is as natural as rest or play
- External control and coercion are not the only ways of bringing about effort directed towards the company's ends.
- Commitment to objectives is a function of the rewards associated with their achievement.
- The average human can learn to accept and further seek responsibility.
- The capacity to exercise imagination and other creative qualities is widely distributed.

### Figuring out if an organizational manager follows Theory X or Theory Y

You can observe how the manager's staff react when the boss is absent:

- If there is no discernible change, then this is a Theory Y environment.
- If everyone visible relaxes, it is a Theory X environment.

### Expectations influence behavior

If a manager assumes that you are going to work diligently and do well, then you are likely to try and meet those expectations!

## Selecting the right person for the job

Generally, the most important influence on programmer productivity is experience, rather than good grades and/or a mathematical aptitude.

## The missing programmer-who-became-manager

Gerald Weinberg states: *"If asked, most programmers probably say they prefer to work alone where they wouldn't be disturbed by other people"*. And so, managers need social skills and the ability to work productively among his/her staff. So, typically, people who are attracted to writing software - and are good at it - will not make good managers later in their careers.

## The recruitment process

Belbin distinguishes between *eligible* and *suitable* candidates.

### Eligible candidate

An eligible candidate is one whose CV shows the "right" number of years in some previous post and the "right" paper qualifications.

### Suitable candidates

These are ones that can actually do the job *well*. It is a common mistake to hire an eligible candidate who isn't suitable (doesn't fit the organization, the domain, etc).

Belbin even goes as far as stating that an ideal candidate may not even be technically eligible, but still ideal since they are more likely to remain loyal to the organization once in post.

### Belbin's Selection methods

Belbin suggests that selection methods centre on the assessment of **actual skills** rather than past experience and also a willingness to provide training to make good minor gaps in expertise.

### A general approach for finding staff

#### 1. Create a job specification

The requirements of the job should be documented and agreed upon.

#### 2. Create a job holder profile

Using the job specification, a profile of the person needed to carry out the job is constructed. The qualities, qualifications, education and experience required would be listed.

#### 3. Obtain applicants

An advertisement would be placed, either internally or outside (on the internet). The job holder profile would be examined carefully to identify the medium most likely to reach the largest number of potential applications at least cost.

#### 4. Examine CVs

These should be read carefully and compared to the job holder profile.

#### 5. Interview (and under candidate assessment methods)

There are many ways to conduct interviews. Personality tests and the examination of samples of previous work are some of the many approaches. These must relate to specific qualities detailed in the job holder profile.

Interviews are the most commonly used method. The interview should have a technical nature. Any time gaps in education and employment history would be investigated, and the precise nature of jobs previously done would need to be explored.

## When a new team member joins

When a new team member is recruited, the team leader will need to plan that person's induction into the team very carefully. It will be tough, but it will pay off eventually when the new recruit becomes a fully effective member of the team.

## Training

The team leader should be aware of the need to continuously train the needs of the team members.

## Motivation

How do we motivate people to work?

**The amount of output will often be constrained by group norms, informal, even unspoken agreements among colleagues about the amount to be produced**.

### The Taylorist model

Here, piece-rates and sale bonuses drive motivation. "What's in it for me".

For many kinds of work environments people seem themselves as part of a *team*, and here, a reward system that make excessive distinctions between coworkers would be detrimental to the overall motivation.

### Maslow's hierarchy of needs

Other motivators than just cash drives employees.

Abraham Maslow suggests that there is a hierarchy of needs.

**As lower levels become satisfied, gradually higher level needs emerge**. We want power!

The highest level need is the need for "self-actualization". The feeling that you are completely fulfilling your potential (holy crap, that sounds awesome!)

### People are motivated by different things at different career levels

The mature employee with an already great salary is probably not as motivated by a salary increase as something else like responsibility or more autonomy.

### Herzberg's two-factor theory

According to Herzberg, two factors about a job were of importance:

- Hygiene or maintenance factors which can make employees dissatisfied if they are not right. For example, working conditions or the level of pay.
- Motivators, which make you feel that the job is worthwhile, like a sense of achievement or the nature of the work itself.

### The expectancy theory of motivation

Vroom defines three influences on motivation:

- **Expectancy**, the belief that working harder will lead to a better performance.
- **Instrumentality**, the belief that better performance will be rewarded.
- **Perceived value**, of the resulting reward.

When all these 3 factors are high, motivation will be high.

### The Oldham-Hackman job characteristics model

Oldham and Hackman suggest that the satisfaction that a job gives is based on five factors:

- **Skill variety**, the number of different skills that the job holder has the opportunity to exercise.
- **Task identity**, the degree to which your work and its results are identifiable as belonging to you.
- **Task significance**, the degree to which your job has an influence on others.
- **Autonomy**, the discretion you have about the way that you do the job
- **Feedback**, the information you get back about the results of your work.

### Important lesson

When it comes to software developers, activities should be signed so that, where possible, staff follow the progress of a particular product and feel personally associated with it.

### Improving motivation

- **Setting specific goals**: If you set demanding, yet acceptable goals for your staff, it may motivate them. If you involve the staff in setting the goals, it helps to gain acceptance of them.

- **Providing feedback**: Staff have to have regular feedback about how they are progressing with the agreed goals.

- **Job design**: Jobs can be altered to make them more interesting and give staff more feeling of responsibility.
  -	**Job enlargement**: The scope of the job is increased so that the member of staff carries out a wider range of activities.
	- **Job enrichment**: Here, the job is changed so that the holder carries out tasks that are normally done at a higher, managerial, level.

## Working in groups/teams

Software developers can have a hard time working in groups.

### Becoming a team

Simply throwing people together does not mean that they will immediately be able to work together as a team.

The "cookbook" states that teams should go through five basic stages of development:

- **Forming** - The members of the group get to know each other and try to set up some ground rules about behavior.

- **Storming** - Conflicts arise as various members of the group try to exert leadership and the group's methods of operation are being established.

- **Norming**: Conflicts are largely settled and a feeling of group identity emerges.

- **Performing**: The emphasis is now on the tasks at hand.

- **Adjourning**: The group disbands.

### Forming the right group of people

There are different research into the best mix of personalities in a project team (as well as its ideal size).

Belbin came to the conclusion that teams needed a balance of different types of people:

- **The chair**: Not necessarily a brilliant leader, but must be good at running meetings, being calm, strong and tolerant.

- **The plant**: Someone who is essentially very good at generating ideas and potential solutions to problems.

- **The monitor-evaluator**: Good at evaluating ideas and potential solutions and helping to select the best one.

- **The shaper**: Rather a worrier, who helps to direct the team's attention to the important issues.

- **The team worker**: Skilled at creating a good working environment, for example by jollying people along.

- **The Resource investigator**: Adept at finding resources in terms of both physical resources and information.

- **The completer-finisher**: Good at completing tasks

- **The company worker**: A good team player who is willing to undertake less attractive tasks if they are needed for team success.

## Group performance

Some tasks are better performed as a group while others are best done on an individual basis.

### Categories of group tasks

#### Additive tasks

These are ones where the efforts of each participant are added together to get the final result.

#### Compensatory tasks

These are ones where multiple people are tasked with the same thing and then the best one is used. For example, tasking everyone with providing an estimate for how long something will take. Then all answers are collected and averaged.

#### Disjunctive tasks

For those, the effectiveness of the group depends on:

- Someone coming up with the right answer
- The others recognizing it as being correct.

Here, the group can only be as good as its best member and no better.

#### Conjunctive tasks

**Here, the progress is governed by the rate of the slowest performer. Software production where different staff are responsible for different modules seems to be a prime example of this**. The overall task is not completed until every participants work is complete.

## Decision making

There are some categories of decisions

- **Structured decisions**: These are simple, routine decisions where rules can be applied in a fairly straightforward way.

- **Unstructured decisions**: These are more complex and often require a degree of creativity.

### Mental obstacles to good decision making

Often, decisions are being made based on incomplete information and are largely intuitive.

There are some mental obstacles to effective intuitive thinking:

#### Faulty heuristics

Heuristics are based only on the information that is to hand, and that can be misleading.

Also, they are based on stereotypes. Rules of thumb might not go for a specific project or organization.

#### Escalation of commitment

It can be difficult to commit to altering a decision with time, even in the face of evidence that it is wrong.

#### Information overload

If one is presented with too much information, it can be difficult to see things clear.

### Group decision making

Groups are less effective when dealing with poorly structured problems, which need creative solutions. Brainstorming techniques have been developed to help groups in such situations, but research shows that people often come up with more ideas individually than in a group.

### How to improve group decision making with the Delphi technique

Given a problem, the Delphi technique has the following steps:

1. The cooperation of a number of experts is enlisted.
2. The problem is presented to the experts.
3. The experts record their recommendations.
4. These recommendations are collated and reproduced.
5. The collected responses are recirculated.
6. The experts comment on the ideas of others and modify their recommendations if inspired.
7. If the leader detects a consensus, then the process is stopped, otherwise the comments are recirculated to the experts.

## Power

Power comes from either:

- a persons position (position power)
- the persons individual qualities (personal power).

Hopefully, it is a combination.

### Kinds of position power

- **Coercive power** - the ability to force someone to do something by threatening with punishment.
- **Connection power** - Having access to those who have power.
- **Legitimate power** - A person has a title that has special status.
- **Reward power** - The holder can give rewards to those who carry out tasks to their satisfaction.

### Kinds of personal power

- Expert power - Comes from being the person who is able to do a specialized task.
- Information power - Comes from having access to information that others do not have access to.
- Referent power - Comes from being attractive.

## Leadership styles

There are different ways to be a leader.

**We can be directive vs permissive and autocratic vs democratic**.

Some relevant combinations:

- **Directive autocrat**: Makes decisions alone with close supervision of their implementation (so just an egotistic maniac, I love it!)

- **Permissive autocrat**: Makes decisions alone, but gives subordinates latitude in implementation.

- **Directive democrat**: Makes decisions participatively, but closely supervises their implementation.

- **Permissive democrat**: Makes decisions participatively and gives subordinates latitude in implementation.

## Organizational structures

### Formal vs Informal structures

In a *formal* structure, it is a hierarchy where everyone has a boss who has a boss who has a ... .

An *informal* structure grows organically among members of staff during the course of work. It is typically this informal structure that comes into play when something unexpected happens.

### Hierarchical approach

This is a traditional management structure which is based on the concept of hierarchy. Each member of staff has only one manager. A manager has responsibility for several members of staff. Authority flows from the top down through the structure.

## Departmentalization

Has to do with how we break staff up into teams.

### Functional departmentalization

Here, staff is a pool from which we can pick out individual members for particular tasks.

### Task-oriented departmentalization

Here, we would construct a project team where programmers and system analysts, for example, would be grouped together in order to implement a specific long-term project (or maybe exist on a permanent basis).

## Centralized vs. Decentralized group structures

### Decentralized group structure

Here, group members would make major decisions collectively and there would be a large degree of free communication among group members.

These tend to move more slowly since it takes time to debate stuff.
The bigger the group, the slower it gets.

### Centralized group structure

Here, the group would be broken down into sections, each of which would be directed by a leader who communicates on behalf of the section with other groups.

On really time-critical projects, a centralized structure is essential.

### Controlled decentralized groups

Here, a project team is made of groups under the leadership of senior programmers. Here, there is free communication and a practice of reviewing each others work.
