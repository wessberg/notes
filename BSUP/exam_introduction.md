# Exam Introduction

> Limit: 5 minutes

Thoughts from reading the report:

- Virtual teams - We had synchronous communication and were geographically separated. Communication and coordination lead to cooperation.

- Problem: Tacit knowledge-sharing wasn't optimal in the beginning since we worked in separate locations and didn't do any pair programming.

- Problem: We write about splitting ourselves into smaller teams, but we probably should have written pair programming.

**We had stand-ups every 2nd day, 1 of which were via video conference**.

**We did three hour meetings once per iteration that combined Sprint Planning, Review and Retrospective**.

**1-week sprints, starting each Tuesday with Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective and then Sprint Planning**.

## My 5 minutes

I want to spend my 5 minutes with some reflection over where we didn't follow the agile principles in the project. Some of this I believe is caused by the nature of the project while some of it is due to some issues in our own implementation of Scrum, which is based on the Agile methodology.

One of the main principles of Agile is close customer collaboration. In terms of the Scrum framework, which we implemented, this may include the customer's presence and participation in ceremonies such as Sprint Planning and Sprint Review.

However, the meetings we did have with the customer were never centered around writing new user stories and defining acceptance tests for them.

Rather, those meetings required the presence of the full Scrum team and would be placed in the midst of a sprint. Those were status meetings, and had no connection to the ceremonies of the Scrum framework.

To be agile, a greater focus should have been put on continuous delivery of valuable software, which, according to the agile principles, is the primary measure of progress.

Also, our decision to not have a Product Owner in our scrum configuration meant that we had to had to democratically decide which product backlog items should have the highest priority based on our own intuition, rather than having the Product Owner communicate with the customer on a daily basis to assert that the prioritization of the product backlog matched the customer's business interest in terms of what was most valuable here and now.

And, our decision to not have daily contact and only do pair programming at the later stages of the project meant that we had issues with knowledge management. Due to the agile nature of our development process, we expected knowledge to be tacit and shared via osmosis, rather than doing comprehensive explicit documentation. At times, the development team would be very fragmented in terms of knowledge, where members took a specialization role, each on their individual parts of the project. This is not particularly agile, where the cross-functional, self-organizing nature of teams encourages role interchangeability.

At the end of the project, there were at least two epics, that we did not deliver all sub-stories of, namely epic #21 (*"as a user, I want to combine shapes, so that I can create new shapes"*) and epic #2 (*"as a user, I want to render shapes"*).

So, to sum it up, Agile shines due to the nature of most software development projects where requirements change all the time, for example due to changes in the application domain. By growing, rather than building, products, and having short iterations, uncertainty and risk are reduced. While this project didn't have changing requirements, the agile principle of working software rather than comprehensive documentation meant that we had a functional application in the end, even though we didn't deliver every user story.
