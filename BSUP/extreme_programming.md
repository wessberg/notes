# EXtreme Programming (XP)

> [Extreme Programming](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/)

Extreme Programming (XP) is an agile process.
The easiest way for me to understand it is by comparing it with Scrum.

## Difference from Scrum

**A Sprint in Scrum is an Iteration in XP**.
**A Product Owner in Scrum is the Customer in XP**.

It is similar to Scrum, but has some differences:

- Sprints in Scrum are generally a bit longer than in XP. In XP, it is called an *iteration* and it lasts between one or two weeks.

- The Product Backlog items that will be delivered through a Sprint does *not* change in Scrum. It is locked. But, in XP, change is allowed during an iteration.

- In Scrum, the Product Owner orders the list of Product Backlog Items, but it is the team itself that determines the sequence in which they will develop the backlog items. In XP, the customer decides what the team should work on. Though, in practice, Scrum teams practically always work on the highest ordered items.

- Scrum makes no assumptions about engineering practices. XP does. **It requires TDD, pair programming and other things**.

- Scrum has ceremonies such as Sprint Review, but XP solicits feedback immediately.

### Problems with XP

It is a subjective thing, but it seems hypocritical to say "hey, we're using self-organizing teams", but then require some specific engineering practices of the team.

### XP in Scrum

You can see Scrum as a refinement of XP. In practice, lots of scrum teams use the practices of XP such as pair programming and TDD.
