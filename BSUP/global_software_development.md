With GSD, oftentimes tasks take a lot more time to complete than in collocated teams. one of the reasons is the relative lack of communication and coordination.

But a great benefit can be productive hours of a day which can be extended from the 8-10 hour norm to 24-hours by working across multiple timezones.

Of course, this wouldn't be a great thing if we were using virtual teams where synchronous communication is key.

## Issues with physical separation

Whether the separation is very local - sitting in two adjacent office buildings - or very global - working across national borders, the issues are very similar.

### Strategic issues

Deciding how to divide up work across sites is difficult. Also, the organization's fundamental resistance to GSD can be a challenge. Many believe their jobs are threatened and experience a loss of control.

### Cultural issues

Cultures differ on many critical dimensions, such as the need for structure, attitudes toward hierarchy, sense of time and communication styles. This can be difficult because misunderstandings can happen.

### Knowledge management issues

Promptly and uniformly sharing information from customers and the market among the development teams can be difficult. And, in terms of agile where knowledge is tacit - it can be especially difficult, since the knowledge is shared through "osmosis".

It might be that the distributed teams aren't aware of which tasks are currently on the critical path.

### Project and process management issues

If two distributed teams define a process differently, we have an issue. Synchronization requires commonly defined milestones and a clear entry and exit criteria!

### Technical issues

I wouldn't call it as relevant anymore, but this goes for sharing data and communicating across multiple sites where connectivity may be limited.
