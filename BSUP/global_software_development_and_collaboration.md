## Different kinds of global distance

- Geographic distance: Being physically separate from each other.

- Temporal distance: Living in different time zones make synchronous communication very difficult.

- Cultural distance: Negatively impacts the level of understanding and appreciation of the activities and efforts of remote colleagues.

- Linguistic distance: The lack of a common native language creates further barriers to communication.
