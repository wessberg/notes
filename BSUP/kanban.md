> [Kanban vs Scrum vs XP](https://manifesto.co.uk/kanban-vs-scrum-vs-xp-an-agile-comparison/)

Kanban is an agile process.

Here' the workflow is visualized. Work is broken down into **small, discrete items and written on a card which is stuck to a board**.

This board has different columns such as *Ready*, *In progress*, *ready for review*, *done*, etc, and the cards move through these columns accordingly.

**The number of items that can be in progress at any one time is strictly limited**.

**The average time it takes to complete an item is called *cycle time*, and it is tracked and optimized**.

## Kanban and Scrum

Kanban has no ceremonies or roles. It doesn't have any iterations/sprints either - but they can be incorporated if desired.

**The Kanban board is often adopted by Scrum teams in the form of a *task board* and is used to track progress throughout a sprint**.

This is crucial to remember. So, Scrum's *task board* is in fact a Kanban Board.

- Kanban teams tracks cycle time and optimizes for lead times that are as short and predictable as possible. Scrum teams, instead, aims to improve its**output over successive sprints and to improve the velocity of the team**.
