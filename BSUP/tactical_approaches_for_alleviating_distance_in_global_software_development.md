## Global software development

It has become very common to do offshore outsourcing of some or even all of the programming work.

There are two critical strategic reasons for this:

- Cost advantage
- A large labor pool

We can now coordinate effectively over large distances due to the internet and the various ways of communicating.

Organizations are therefore shrinking and externalizing things like sales, manufacturing and even programming.

### Difficulties with coordination and control over distance

*Coordination* is the act of integrating each task with each organizational unit, so the unit contributes to the overall objective.

*Control* is the process of adhering to goals, policies, standards and quality levels.

*Communication* greatly affects both - but distance negatively affects communication, which in turn reduces coordination effectiveness.

## Challenge of distance within agile

In Agile, knowledge is not explicitly documented, but rather implied and intuitively understood by the group. This works due to the self-organizing nature of agile project teams. But, all those dynamics that play into group formation will be very challenging if the group is not physically together.

This would work a lot better within traditional software development with a functional approach where individual team members could be assigned a specific task/activity and where knowledge is explicit. It could in principle work quite well.

## How to fix it

In general, the less need there is to communicate and clarify requirements, the better. If the tasks are relatively stable and the requirements are relatively limited, it can be done.

**Rule 1: Reduce intensive collaboration**.

The organizational culture differences between the two organizations will also play a role in terms of the unit's norms and values. Which methodologies and project management practices are used can vary greatly. And, national cultural practices can also be very different. Cultural norms or language differences play a big part in how we collaborate professionally.

**Rule 2: Reduce cultural distance**.

Asynchronous communication are fine for many cases, but synchronous communication such as a phone call or face-to-face meeting has some advantages: A small issue can take days of back-and-forth discussions over email or Slack, but a brief conversation will often quickly clarify and hopefully resolve the issue. So speaking with colleagues that are not sitting in the same room as you can greatly reduce the time taken to solve issues.

Synchronous communication can be difficult if the time zones are very different.

If you use the *follow-the-sun* approach where another team takes over when the team leaves, it will be near to impossible to do synchronous work due to the large difference in time zones.

**Rule 3: Reduce temporal distance**.
