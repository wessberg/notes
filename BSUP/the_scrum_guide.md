## Scrum

Scrum is a framework for **developing and sustaining** complex products.
It is a framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value.

It is:

- Lightweight
- Simple to understand
- Difficult to master

It is **NOT**:

- A process
- A technique

Rather, it is a framework within which you can employ various processes and techniques.

The Scrum framework consists of Scrum teams and their associated roles, events, artifacts and rules.

Scrum is an **iterative**, **incremental** approach **to optimize predictability and control risk**.

### Scrum Events/Ceremonies

Scrum has four formal events that target inspection and adaption:

- Sprint Planning
- Daily scrum
- Sprint Review
- Sprint Retrospective

### Empirical process control theory (Empiricism)

Empiricism asserts that knowledge comes from experience *and* making decisions based on what is known.

Scrum is founded on this.

Every implementation of empiricism has the following three things:

### 1. Transparency

Significant aspects of the process must be visible to those responsible for the outcome.

There must be a common standard for this, so that observers share a common understanding of what is being seen.

**For example, those performing the work and those accepting the work product mus share a common definition of "Done"**.

### 2. Inspection

Scrum artifacts must be frequently inspected. Scrum users must progress toward a Sprint Goal to detect undesirable variances.

**This inspection should not be so frequent that inspection gets in the way of the work**!

### 3. Adaption

If one or more aspects of a process deviate outside acceptable limits, the process or the material being processed must be adjusted.

## The Scrum team

A Scrum team has:

- A Product Owner
- A Scrum Master
- The Development Team

**Scrum Teams are self-organizing and cross-functional**.

The scrum team chooses how best to accomplish their work, rather than being directed by others outside the team.

Cross-functional teams have all competencies needed to accomplish the work without depending on others not part of the team!

Scrum Teams deliver products iteratively and incrementally. Incremental deliveries of "Done" product ensure a potentially useful version of working product is always available!

## Product Backlog management

Includes:

- Clearly expressing Product Backlog items

- Ordering the items in the Product Backlog to best achieve goals and missions.

- Optimizing the value of the work the development team performs.

- Ensuring that the Product Backlog is visible, transparent and clear to all, and shows what the Scrum Team will work on next.

- Ensuring the Development Team understands items in the Product Backlog to the level needed.

The Product owner *may* have the development team do those things, but he/she is one responsible for it!

**The Product owner is one person, not a committee**!

No one is allowed to tell the development team to work from a different set of requirements, and the development team isn't allowed to act on what anyone else says!

## The Product Owner

The Product Owner is responsible for **maximizing the value of the product and the work of the development team**.

The Product Owner has the responsibility of **managing the Product Backlog**.

## The Development Team

These are the ones who does the work of delivering a potentially releasable increment of "Done" product at the end of each sprint.

**Only members of the development team create the increment**.

Development teams are:

- Self-organizing. No one, not even the Scrum Master, tells the Development Team how to turn the Product Backlog into increments of potentially releasable functionality.

- Cross-functional. All of the skills required to create a product increment is found in the team.

- There are no "senior developers" or anything. Every member of the development team has the same title.

- There are no sub-teams within the development team.

- Individual members of the team may have specialized skills and areas of focus, but accountability belongs to the development team as a whole!

### Optimal Development Team Size

It must be small enough to remain nimble, and large enough to complete significant work within a Sprint.

Having more than nine members requires too much coordination!

Not counting the Scrum Master nad Product Owner (unless they are actively working on the Sprint Backlog)

## Scrum Master

The Scrum Master makes sure that Scrum is understood and enacted! He/she does this by ensuring that the Scrum Team adheres to Scrum theory, practices and rules.

**The Scrum Master is a servant-leader for the Scrum Team and helps those outside the Scrum Team understand which of their interactions with the Scrum Team are helpful and which aren't**.

### Scrum Master service to the Product Owner

The Scrum Master helps the Product owner with:

- Finding techniques for effective Product Backlog management.
- Ensuring the Product Owner knows how to arrange the Product Backlog to maximize value.
- Understanding and practicing agility.
- **Facilitating Scrum events as requested or needed**.

### Scrum Master service to the Development Team

- Coaching the development team in self-organization and cross-functionality.
- Helping the development team to create high-value products.
- Removing impediments to the Development Team's progress.
- Facilitating Scrum events as requested or needed.
- Coaching the Development Team in organizational environments in which Scrum is not adopted and understood.

### Scrum Master service to the organization

- Leading and coaching the organization in its Scrum adoption.
- Planning Scrum implementations within the organization.
- Helping employees and stakeholders understand and enact Scrum and empirical product development.
- Working with *other* Scrum Masters to increase the effectiveness of the application of Scrum in the organization.

## Scrum Events

These are used **to create regularity** and **to minimize the need for meetings not defined in Scrum**.

**All events have a maximum duration**.

A Sprint has **a fixed length. It cannot be shortened or lengthened**.

## The Sprint

While the Sprint itself is an event, its more of a container for all other events.

A Sprint has a maximum duration of one month (preferably shorter than that). The outcome of every sprint is a "finished" product in the sense that **it is usable and potentially releasable**.

A new sprint starts **immediately** after the conclusion of the previous Sprint.

The sprint contain:

- Sprint Planning
- Daily Scrums
- The development work
- Sprint Review
- Sprint Retrospective

### During the sprint

- No changes are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal.
- Quality goals do not decrease
- Scope may be clarified and re-negotiated between the Product Owner and Development Team as more is learned.

### Sprint as a project

You can consider a sprint as a project with no more than a one-month horizon.

### Sprint goal

Each sprint has a definition of what is to be built.

### Why the one-month limit

If it were longer, the definition of what is being built may change (the requirements are in flux). Complexity may rise - and then risk.

**Sprints enable predictability by ensuring inspection and adaption of progress toward a Sprint Goal at least every calendar month**.

### Cancelling a Sprint

A Sprint can be cancelled, **but only by the Product Owner**.

One reason would be that the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete.
If the company changes direction or if market or technology conditions change, this might happen.

Cancellation rarely makes sense due to the short duration of each sprint.

#### What to do when a sprint is cancelled

Look at the Product Backlog items (those that are "Done"). If some of it is potentially releasable, the Product Owner typically accepts it.

**All incomplete Product Backlog items are re-estimated and put back on the Product Backlog**.

## Sprint Planning

This is where the work to be performed in the Sprint is planned. **This plan is created by the collaborative work of the entire Scrum team**.

For a one-month sprint, **planning must take no longer than 8 hours**. For shorter sprints, it should be shorter too.

**It is the Scrum Masters responsibility to ensure that the event takes place and that attendants understand its purpose**.

Sprint planning answers:

- What can be delivered in the increment resulting from the upcoming Sprint?
- How will the work needed to deliver the increment be achieved?

The Product Owner explains the objective of the sprint (not the sprint goal) as well as the Product Backlog items that is required to achieve that Sprint Goal.

### 1. What can be delivered in the increment resulting from the upcoming sprint

We already know the sprint goal, and we already have:

- The Product Backlog to look at.
- The latest product increment (the product in its current state).
- The projected capacity of the development team during the sprint (how many developers will be available for how many hours per day)
- The knowledge of how the development team have performed in the past.

**How many items we select from the Product Backlog for the sprint is solely up the development team! They are the ones who can best assess what can be accomplished over the upcoming sprint**.

The Scrum team then together crafts the final Sprint Goal. It should correlate with the one the Product Owner suggested.

### 2. How will the chosen work get done

#### Sprint Backlog

The selected backlog items selected for the Sprint, including the *plan* for delivering them is called the Sprint Backlog.

It makes all of the work that the Development Team identifies as necessary to meet the Sprint Goal visible.

As new work is required, the Development team adds it to the Sprint Backlog. As work is performed or completed, the estimated remaining work is updated.

**The Sprint Backlog may be modified throughout the sprint, and items may even be removed if deemed unnecessary to reach the Sprint Goal**.

**Only the Development Team can change its Sprint backlog during a Sprint. Not the Scrum Team; The Development Team**.

#### Sprint items

Now, the Sprint backlog items are broken into work items of varying size and effort. These work items should preferably be units of maximum one day or less.

#### Taking ownership of tasks

The Development Team self-organizes to undertake the work in the Sprint Backlog, both during Sprint Planning and as needed throughout the Sprint.

### Other people in the Sprint Planning meeting

The Scrum Team is allowed to invite other people to attend in order to provide technical or domain advice.

## Daily Scrum

"The standup meeting". It is a 15-minute max event for the Development Team to synchronize activities and create a plan for the next 24 hours.

It is held **at the same time and place each day to reduce complexity**.

Each team member explains:

- What he/she did yesterday
- What he/she will do today
- If he/she has any troubles that may prevent him/her from achieving the Sprint Goal

The Daily Scrum is used to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal.

### The Scrum Masters role in the Daily Scrum

The Scrum Master ensures that the team holds the meeting, but it is the team that is responsible for conducting it. The Scrum Master teaches the Development Team to respect the 15-minute limit.

## Sprint Review

A Sprint Review is held at the end of the Sprint to inspect the Increment and adapt the Product Backlog if needed.

Here, the Scrum Team and stakeholders collaborate about what was done in the Sprint.

There, attendees collaborate on the next things that could be done to optimize value.

This is **a four-hour maximum meeting for one-month sprints**.

The attendees of the review are:

- The Scrum Teak
- Key stakeholders invited by the Product Owner.

The Product Owner explains what has been done and what hasn't. He/she also explains what issues the team ran into during the sprint and how the were resolved.

The Development team demonstrates the work that has been done and answers questions about it.

The Product Owner projects likely completion dates based on progress to date - if it is a fixed scope project.

**The result of the Sprint Review is a revised Product Backlog that defines the probable Product Backlog items for the next Sprint**. It may need adjustment to meet new opportunities.

## Sprint Retrospective

This meeting occurs **after** the Sprint Review and **before** Sprint Planning. So, it is the last ceremony of a Sprint,

**It is a three-hour maximum meeting for one-month sprints**.

This is **less focused on the product-outcome of the previous sprint, but instead focuses on how it went in regards to people, relationships, process and tools**.

This is where we locate:

- Things that went well
- Things that didn't

We may implement improvements outside the Sprint Retrospective, but is a formal opportunity to do so.

## Scrum Artifacts

They are all designed to maximize transparency.

### Product Backlog

The Product Backlog is an **ordered list** of everything that might be needed in the product.

It is **the single source of requirements for any changes to be made to the product**.

The Product Owner is responsible for the Product Backlog, including its content and ordering.

A Product Backlog **is never complete**. It evolves with the product and as the environment in which it will be used evolves.

The Product Backlog **is all features, functions, requirements, enhancements and fixes** that constitute the changes to be made to the product in future releases.

**Requirements never stop changing, so a Product Backlog is a living artifact**.

#### Product Backlog Refinement

This is the act of adding detail, estimates, and order to items in the Product Backlog. The Scrum Team decides how and when refinement is done. It can be changed **at any time**.

Higher ordered Product Backlog items are usually clearer and more detailed than lower ordered ones. Those that will occupy the Development Team for an upcoming sprint are refined so that any item can reasonably be "Done".

## Monitoring progress toward a goal

At any point in time, the total work remaining to reach a goal can be summed.

**The Product Owner tracks this total work remaining at least every Sprint Review**.

This information is made transparent to all stakeholders.

## Monitoring Sprint Progress

The total work remaining in a Sprint Backlog can be summed at *any* given time.

This remaining work is tracked at least for every Daily Scrum to project the likelihood of achieving the Sprint Goal.

## Increment

The Increment is **the sum of all the Product Backlog items completed during a Sprint and the value of the increments of all previous sprints**.

At the end of a Sprint, the new Increment must be "Done". This means that it must be in usable condition, even if the Product Owner decides not to release it.

## Artifact transparency

The Scrum Master's job is to work with the Scrum Team and the organization to increase the transparency of the artifacts.

**Transparency is important because decisions to optimize value and control risk are made based on the perceived state of the artifacts**.
