### Virtual teams

A group of people working on a project, but residing in different locations.

*"A group of geographically, organizationally, and/or time dispersed workers brought together by information and telecommunication technologies to accomplish one or more organizational tasks"*.

In virtual teams, there are a high level of interdependence and cooperation among team members, in comparison with other outsourcing/insourcing of work.

Especially in the case of self-organizing teams, it is crucial to have as many functions performed in all locations to avoid silos which can affect team dynamics and performance.

Advantages of virtual teams over loosely coupled distributed teams are also:

- It's easier to create a common spirit and a shared goal across locations.

- The network of virtual teams is more stable, which increases constancy.

- Know-how is shared and transferred across locations as a part of teamwork that reduces risk, especially for long-term projects.

- The risks regarding immoderate competition or blockade situations are lower.
