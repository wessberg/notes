## Bit manipulation

This includes:

- [X] Arithmetic and logical shifts
- [X] Bit masks
- [X] Bit multiplication and division
- [X] What is an absolute value?

## Explicit Free lists

- [X] Practice illustrating how a block looks on an explicit free list

- [ ] Explain instructions such as `MOV`.

## Strings

- [X] Be able to explain how a string is initialized
- [X] Be able to explain where a string is located in memory.

## Hardware Organization

- [X] Be able to explain and draw the full hardware organization of a typical system

## Exercises and deliverables
