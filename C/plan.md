- [ ] Explain instructions such as `MOV`.

## Strings

- [ ] Be able to explain how a string is initialized
- [ ] Be able to explain where a string is located in memory.
- [ ] Be able to explain why such strings are read-only

## Alignment

## Compilation

- [ ] Be able to explain the four phases (preprocessing, compiling, assembling and linking)

## Hardware Organization

- [ ] Be able to explain and draw the full hardware organization of a typical system

## Exercises and deliverables

- [ ] Read through all deliverables and mandatory assignments - also those you didn't finish

## Reading
