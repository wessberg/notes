# CRYPTO Handbook

This is a collection of things I've learned and would like to remind myself in Cryptocurrency trading.

## 1. Nothing is certain in Crypto, including these rules

Everything here should be taken somewhat lightly since rules change all the time and nothing is certain in the world of cryptocurrencies.

## 2. There is always a dip in January

Asian New Year leads to fiat outflow in January, often continuing into February.

You should tether your gains in USD before the end of December.

## 3. The market reacts quickly and painfully to everything relating to the Chinese or South Korean markets

There are daily talks of regulation, but whenever the news are from China or South Korea, the market will dip - not only Bitcoin, but everything. Take your earnings and tether them to USD as soon as any news like this pop up.
