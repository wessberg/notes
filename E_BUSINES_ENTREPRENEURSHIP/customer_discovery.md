# Customer Discovery

> Chapter 4, Startup Owner's Manual

## Customer Development Process

We are in the first two phases:

- Customer Discovery
- Customer Validation

We don't care about the next phases, Customer Creation and Company building since these are only relevant when we've found a business model that has been validated and are ready to scale the company (turn the startup into a company).

## The Customer Discovery Philosophy

You are going to build your product for the *few*, not the many. When doing Customer Discovery, find your niche and perform Customer Development with them.

We are searching for the problem/solution fit. "Have we found a problem lots of people want us to solve (or a need they want us to fill)?". "Does our solution solve the problem in a compelling way?".

### Earlyvangelists

These early customers could be called *"Earlyvangelists"*.

These are enthusiasts who spread the good news about your product to friends, family, or co-workers. These are the ones who are willing to take a leap of faith on an early product.

**"Earlyvangelists" are not customers who get access to the product for free**. It is those who are willing to pay for early access to the product.

### The Business Model Canvas as the Customer Discovery Scorecard

To have a shared and clear understanding of the business model throughout the company, use the Business Model Canvas.

It can be used as a "scorecard" for the Customer Development team to track progress in searching for a business model. It could be updated, say, once a week to reflect any pivots and/or iterations, highlighting in red the changes from last week.

Generate a new canvas each week. Your stack of canvases then becomes the chronicle of your startup over time.

## Customer Discovery phases

1. State Hypotheses. Draw Business Model Canvas
2. Test the Problem
3. Test the Solution
4. Verify or pivot

## Red Ocean vs Blue Ocean

"Jump in with everyone else. Or, jump to the right (empty sea)".

### Red Ocean

"Bloody competition to take a larger share of the market"

- Compete in an existing market
- Beat the competition
- Exploit existing demand
- Make the value-cost tradeoff
- Make a strategic choice of differentiation or low cost

### Blue Ocean

"Why compete when you don't have to?"

"It won't work to offer a little more for a little less".

Go from competition to alternatives.

- Create uncontested market space
- Make the competition irrelevant
- Create and capture new demand
- Break the value-cost tradeoff
- Pursue differentiation AND low cost
