# Customer Discovery

## The Customer Validation Philosophy

Every startup needs a method for validating the business model with real customers and orders.

Turns hypotheses into facts about basic questions like:

- Do we understand the sales/user acquisition process?
- Is it repeatable?
- Can we prove it's repeatable?
- Have we tested sales and distribution channels?
- Are we confident we can scale orders/users into a profitable business?
- Have we correctly positioned the product and the company?

Here we run a continuing series of quantitative pass/fail tests to determine whether there's strong enough product/market fit to justify scaling sales and marketing spending.

## What has been achieved by now from Customer Discovery

- **Value Proposition**: You affirmed it with a few dozen to a hundred people.
- Customer Segments: You have a hypothesis about customer archetypes
- *Customer Relationships*: You tested several "get, keep, and grow" activities.
- *Channel*: You understand your key channel partners, and some have expressed interest
- *Revenue model*: The company has an idea of how to price its offering

### Sales Roadmap

This uses all we've learned from Customer Discovery to guide the creation of a sales funnel specifically for our company. It answers:

- Who influences a sale? Who recommends a sale?
- Who is the decision-maker? Who is the economic buyer (and potential saboteur)?
- Where is the budget for purchasing the type of product we're selling
- How many sales calls are needed to make one sale?
- How long does an average sale take from beginning to end?
- What is the selling strategy? Is this a solution sale?
- If so, what are key customer problems?
- What's the profile of optimal visionary buyers?
- Where will the traffic come from? Will it stick?
- Will the product be strong enough to grow virally?

If a company doesn't have **proven** answers to these questions, few sales will happen, and those that do occur will result from heroic single-shot efforts.

**Developing a sales roadmap is part of the search for a business model**!

So, don't scale of the sales force in order to do customer validation. Instead, build a roadmap to figure out how to get repeatable sales (test product/market fit). Once that is done, *then* build a sales organization.

## Make early sales to Earlyvangelists

You should be targeting Earlyvangelists as your first paying customers. If you can't sell it to them, it **doesn't** get better over time.

## Dont perform premature scaling

That's a typical failure. Don't scale with an unproven business model.

Too often, sales people are fired an their marketing programs killed when the startup faces a major pivot after scaling too early.

## Prioritize what needs to be validated

Don't validate EVERYTHING. That would take a 100 years. But prioritize and validate the most important parts of your business model before proceeding.

With the Business Model Canvas, it is wise to prioritize:

- Value Proposition
- Customer Relationships
- Channel
- Revenue Model

It doesn't have to be, though.

## Summary

Customer Discovery first tested hypotheses about the business model with a small group of customers **who were asked for opinions, not orders**. It didn't deliver any *proven*, hard facts about who would buy or how scalable the business was.

Customer *validation* goes to the next step and determines whether a product/market fit can be validated by orders or usage. So - test the MVP. How? By asking for orders!

Customer Validation is complete when the company has answers to the following questions:

1. *Can the business scale?* (Will a dollar spent on customer acquisition yield more then a dollar's worth of incremental revenue, page views, downloads or clicks?)
2. *Is there a repeatable and scalable sales roadmap*?
3. *Is the sales funnel predictable*? Do the same sales programs and tactics consistently deliver and adequate profitable flow of customers through the funnel?

## Customer Validation Phases

1. Get Ready to Sell
	- Product positioning
	- Building the high-fidelity MVP
	- Sales/Marketing materials for "test selling" efforts
	- Hiring a sales closer
	- A distribution channel plan
	- Refining a sales roadmap
	- Creating an advisory board

2. Get Out of the Building
	- Will customers validate your business model by buying your product?
	- Getting feedback is as important as getting orders.
	- To "get out of the building" with a software startup, you can do so by launching the product and seeing if it actually attract customers who active are buy. Do more than a handful of real customers behave as the hypotheses suggest they will? 
3. Develop Positioning
4. Verify
	- Here we stop all activity to conduct a detailed pivot-or-proceed analysis and verify that customer validation is complete and the company knows how to scale. If it is, it is ready to reap the rewards for founders and investors alike. In short: "Is this a business worth doing" and devoting several years of backbreaking work for? Will it generate enough revenue, growth and profits to achieve the founders and investors goals?

## Pivot or Proceed

A few things that may lead to a pivot:

- The company needs 10,000 customers in order to be profitable, but the market isn't that large
- Customer acquisition or channel costs are too high, rendering the company unprofitable
- The sales roadmap is too long and complex, making the cost of sales way too high
- Despite best efforts, referrals just aren't delivering additional customers.

To translate all those piles of data into something useful, it is a good idea to make it as visual as possible!

### Validate Your Business Model

Blablabla proven, tested, it keeps saying the same stuff over and over.

### Validate the Financial Model

Do all tests point to a scalable, sizable business? AND can it happen before the company runs out of money?

This is where you'll find if you have a business, a hobby, or a tax loss.

**For a startup with physical products**:

- *Value Proposition*: What are product cost, market size, attainable market share, and customer impact of network effects?

- *Customer relationships*: What are customer acquisition costs, prospect conversion rates, customer lifetime value, and customer switching costs that the company may have to pay?

- *Market type*: Different market types drive different revenue curves to consider in longer-term revenue predictions.

- *Cost structure*: What are the basic operating costs of the business?

- *Channel*: What are the costs of selling through the channel?

- *Revenue Streams*: What are the average selling price, total achievable revenue, and number of customers a year?

- *Burn Rate*: How much cash is the company spending a month? When will the company run out of cash?

**For a software startup**:

- *Value Proposition*: What is the estimated per-user cost, and are there any incremental costs when one's added? Estimate market size, attainable market share, and the customer impact of referrals or network effects

- *Customer relationships*: What are customer acquisition costs, prospect conversion and retention rates, and how many new customers or users will your current customers get you virally, for free?

- *Market type*: Different market types drive different revenue curves to consider in longer-term revenue predictions.

- *Cost structure*: What are the basic operating costs of the business?

- *Channel*: What are the costs of selling through the channel? Payments to app stores, etc.

- *Revenue Streams*: What are the average selling price, total achievable revenue, and how long or how often will customers spend?

- *Burn Rate*: How much cash is the company spending a month? When will the company run out of cash?

**Take your time! If you take a pile of money to move forward here and fail, it will at least cost you a significant portion of your founders' equity, and it will often cost you your job**!
