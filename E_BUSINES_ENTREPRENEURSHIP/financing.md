# Financing

> Chapter 5-12, The Startup Funding Book

## Co-founders

Investors want at the very least two founders: one business-oriented and one technical oriented founder.

Even if you possess both skills, you still need a co-founders. No investors want to invest in single-man teams. It sends the wrong signals and raises questions such as if you're hard to work with, arrogant, etc. So as an entrepreneurial software developer, find a business oriented co-founder.

### You need a salesperson now!

You need the sales guy from day one to build all external relationships.

### Outsourcing scares away investors

All you have are assumptions. When you ask something from the outside to build it, features are going to change many times over when your assumptions are proven wrong and you need to change key features. Investors want the product-building competencies to be present in your founding team. Also, they want all parts of the team to be committed on the same level as you, the founder. The people you outsource to just aren't committed on the same level as you.

## Financing from friends and family

Beside self-financing, it is actually the second-largest source of funding for startups!

But you have to careful not to destroy relationships here. Anyone who isn't an entrepreneur or professional investor doesn't understand just how risky startups are or how many startups fail. So make sure they understand all of those things. So think really hard before accepting funding from friends and family. They have to know the high risk - and then also that the equity is illiquid - They have to wait, say, 10 years or so for any return on investment to be paid out.

## Financing from Startup Accelerators

Accelerators are like "startup factories". Your startup is taken in for a short period of time, say, three to six months, involving training and mentoring, as if you were attending business school or something. You are working towards "demo day" where VCs, angels and other kinds of investors will show up and where you can present your project.

Other cool stuff is that the most popular accelerators usually receive hundreds of applicants but only take in a few - so in the eyes of an investor, the not-so-ambitious and untalented people have already been filtered out - so the investors don't have to. Investors are almost already interested just by the fact that the startup has nee through an accelerator program (if the accelerator is popular and has a great reputation, like Y Combinator).

Be careful of not picking the wrong accelerators. You are giving away equity to it - so make sure that they have great mentors and great data from past startups that has been through their programme. So **check out their mentors**!

Also make sure that you *do* get access to investors. There are so many accelerators out there, that investors simply can't attend demo day for each one.

### Business model of accelerators

Most of them provide you with a bit of cash, mentoring, training, workshops and even a small office. For that, you pay 3-8% of your equity. They don't want to make money on training and office space, but on your success - so they are really invested in making sure you do great work.

**So in a sense, accelerators behave like small VCs**.

Accelerators go for high risk/high reward startups (again, like VCs) - but unlike VCs who are looking for a more mature company with a proven business model, accelerators comes in much earlier because of the small-scale investment required.

## Incubators

Incubators are kind of like accelerators in that you are taken in and there are other startups around, but it is basically just office space. It helps you connect, but leaves everything else to you. You'll probably stay there for longer than three to six months (unless you become wildly successful in which case - congratulations).

## Financing from Business Angels

Theses are **private people who invest their own money in startups**.
One example of a business angel could be a entrepreneur who has had success selling his/her own company and is now looking for exciting startups worth investing in.

### Why do business angels invest

For their own benefit, for your benefit, and for the benefit of the world.

- *For their own benefit*: To make money, have fun, avoid boredom, be involved in something interesting, be entrepreneurial, to have something to talk about at parties
- *For your benefit*: They may remember how difficult it was when they started out and want to help you. They want to give something back.
- *For the benefit of the world*: Locally or globally, they want to make a difference that has an impact.

**You rarely convince a business angel to invest if you're only offering them profit**. It has to be fun. Business angels don't only care about money! They are probably rich already or know they could increase their wealth by investing on the stock market or in other asset classes. They fund startups for other reasons also, such as described above.

Of the same reason, business angels invest in anything, as long as they have their hearts in it.

#### Different types of business angels

There are many different kinds of business angels. Here's three classic types:

- **New angels**
  - Typically passive. Wants to be involved on an ad-hoc basis.
  - Invests alone, but you can pool them together to reach your funding goal (for example, use 3-4 different investors).
  - Will typically invest no more than ~300.000DKK (but this varies).
  - They are found within your extended network (friends of friends). They typically don't consider themselves business angels, but they have equity from successful corporate careers or startups.
- **Business Angel networks**
  - Typically, one angel acts as a (very active) lead, while others are more passive
  - Spread risk around more investors - all become more powerful for it.
  - The amount invested varies a lot. But since there are more angels involved, the amounts are usually greater.
  - Can be found in Business Angel network websites. You can approach like like you would approach any other investor.
- **Super angels**
  - Typically very actively using their own network and personal brand to help the startup become a success.
  - Invest alone aor with others they trust.
  - Varies a lot. But these guys are invested. Let's say **up to** around 7 million DKK
  - These are hard to find. Probably better to be introduced via mutual contacts.

#### Business angel networks

Some angels prefer to invest in collaboration with other angels (called "syndication").

Since the angel has limited funds, being parts of a network and investing with others enables the angel to spread investments over several different startups to mitigate some of the risks.

And then it is always nice to have more eyes on the same deal. It gives some kind of comfort to investors. They don't have a large team of people ready to analyze the deal - often they are alone. So it definitely helps to have more eyes on it.

#### Super angels

These are high net worth individuals who have typically earned their money via their own ventures (exits) and decided to invest a significant portion of their proceeds in new startups.

Some do it as a part-time thing while they continue being CEOs in their current jobs. Others are business angels on the side.

- They are usually willing to fund the entire thing themselves.
- They often invest in industries which are similar to the one(s) they made their own money in.

#### New Angels

Often overlooked, these are people who may not perceive themselves as business angels - and therefore they are not members of business angel networks. They don't necessarily advertise themselves as investors, but they are interested in entrepreneurship and they make early-stage investments just like other business angels.

In most cases, they invest smaller sums than other types of angels, and in fewer startups.

It may be difficult or impossible to raise the entire investment from one new angel, but you can get several new angels on board to investment something each. As soon as you have the first investor on board, it becomes easier to get more, because it reduces the feeling of risk for investors.

## Financing from Venture Capitalists

A Venture Capital (VC) fund is typically created by a small group of people called the general partners. **They don't own the majority share of the fund - they have investors too**.

Typically three to five general partners come together to invest in a number of startups. The have something like 5 million euros to invest, but would really like to invest 100 million euro, so they go out to *their* investors and find the remaining 95 million euro. **These millions are actually invested by all of us through the pension funds we contribute to each month**.

Pension funds provide around 95-99% of the capital in VCs, but they are not involved in the day-to-day operations of the fund. That's handled entirely by the general partners.

### How VCs work

**Usually VC funds close after 10 years**. They typically invest in new startups in the first three years, and then use the remaining years for reinvesting in them and for selling the companies to industrial buyers or bringing them to the stock-market via an IPO.

The partners regularly go to the pension funds to try to make a new deal for a VC fund.

**So be on the watch for whether or not the VC fund is actively investing**. Otherwise, they are must likely in fundraising mode themselves. They won't have fresh capital to invest in your startup.

### What motivates VCs to create the funds

Money!

They earn:

- Management fees
  - The partners earn something like two percent of the fund's annual capital just in salaries.
- Carried interest
  - This is a share of the profits of an investment relative to the amount they have contributed to the partnership.
  - They will only get this bonus if the fund returns significantly over some given percent compounded annual interest threshold (typically 8%).

**VC funds need to make it big**! VC general partners will need to return a ton of money to their investors to get their big bonuses!

**The potential return on an investment by a VC fund MUST equal half of the fund's total size (or at least 10 times the invested money) if the VC fund is to be interested**.

That is also the reason for their high risk/high reward strategy. To be able to return significant profits, they must be willing to take som wild bets. This is what venture capital is essentially about. They are positioned at the extreme end of the investor matrix.

In VCs, about 6% of the deals produce about 60% of the returns, and half lose money.

What you have to offer a VC must be revolutionary! Not 10% better than the competition, but ten times better, preferably an entirely new product class.

#### The downside of using VCs

Part of the reason why VC-backed startups fail is naturally that they are typically high-risk ventures and, by nature, have a higher probability of failing.

But more importantly, **it is because of the strategies that VCs want startups to follow**. They are only looking for big exits, so they often "force" the startup to chase a winner takes all strategy.

Getting venture money can be like putting a rocket engine on the back of a car.

Avoid premature scaling before product/market fit has been found. VCs want to avoid this too, though.

#### Series A funding

When a VC generates the first "round" of funding, it is often called "Series A", referring to the first round of preferred stock these investors normally get for their investment. Such rounds are typically around 2-5 million euros in Europe.

#### Seed rounds

This is funding rounds that are even earlier than Series A funding rounds, but where the investments are also a bit smaller.

#### Early stage VC funding

If you are looking for initial venture capital, focus only on those early stage funds who are investing in seed and Series A - not the other venture funds who invest in later stages.

The bigger the fund - the later they invest.

## Financing from public funding

Many projects find it difficult to attract private funding in the early stages of development, when risk is high. Here's where public funding might help.

### Public funding programmes are political and change over time

They are paid for by the public. One government might believe it's very important. The next one might not.

### Types of public funding

#### Secure Loans

One way is to get a bank loan (which the banks normally won't do because of the high risk), but then the government offers security for the loan through a programme.

The downside is that there is quite a bit of paperwork involved in comparison to getting private funding. And - it is still a loan (and you are usually personally liable) (but that is also a good thing in that you're not giving up equity).

#### Equity financing

Governments might also invest directly in VC funds to give them more funds to invest with.

Or, they may invest directly into startups! This is done by creating independent investment funds funded by public money.
Some even behave like private VCs. They are trying to identify and close funding gaps in the private market.

#### Downsides of public equity financing

Public investment bodies have to invest on market terms. So, like with any financing, you'll still be giving away ownership.

You may also argue that you lose some of the "smart money", but this is not rule. Successful entrepreneurs-turned-investors are usually found in private, and not public, organizations.

So make sure that you don't have a bureaucrat sitting on your board.

#### Grants and co-financing

With public grants, you don't have to repay the grant nor give equity in return. It is the closest you'll get to "free money".

They exist based on the assumption that there is a market failure with funding for a specific kind of activity. So, grants happen for specific things because the government believe that these activities wouldn't have happened without it. Of course, no government would issue grants for things that doesn't help them reach some kind of goal. For example, societal or socio-economic startups that could help society but would never receive private funding.

So, to *get* a grant, what you do must align with the purpose of the grant. What it has been put in the world to achieve must align with your business model and vision.

**Grants are only given when they believe the startup would not be able to continue otherwise**! So you will have to convince the funding body that you will not only help them achieve their goals, but also that you simply cannot proceed without it.

**To get a grant, your application must be absolutely perfect**!

## Financing from Banks

Banks don't care about how great a company you can grow to be, because they are not getting equity in the company - so they won't reap the benefits. They will at most get their loan back plus interest. So, what they care about is as low risk as possible.

Banks might help with a loan if either:

- Your startup has physical assets
- You only need a few thousand euros
- You have personal assets
- You have an established business

Or any combination of the above

For example, if you have a machine, car, etc, that you can resell if you go bankrupt, this lowers the risk for the bank.

Or if you are personally liable, you may put your house up as collateral against a loan.
