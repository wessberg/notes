# Introduction

> Chapter 1 + 2, Startup Owner's Manual

"Startups are not simply smaller versions of large companies". Startups operate in "search" mode, seeking a repeatable and profitable business model, whereas established companies operate in "known" mode where the customers, problems, and necessary product features are already known.

## Definition: Startup

A *Startup* is a **temporary** organization in search of a scalable, repeatable, profitable business model.

## Small Business Entrepreneurship vs Scalable startups

Small Businesses are what the majority of entrepreneurs and startups are found among. These are often service-oriented businesses (think drycleaners, convenience stores, etc).

Scalable Startups are typically technology-driven and are believing their vision will change the world and result in a company with hundreds of millions of dollars in sales. The early days of such scalable startups are about the search for a repeatable and scalable business model. **Scale requires external venture-capital investment to fuel rapid expansion**.

These tend to cluster in technology centers (Silicon Valley, Tel Aviv, etc).

## Large Company Entrepreneurship

This is when large companies attempt to introduce new products into new markets with new customers. The size and culture of large companies make disruptive innovation extremely difficult. In a sense, this is equal to attempting to launch a scalable startup *within* a big company. The company as a whole takes the role of the venture capitalist.

## Social Entrepreneurs

These build on the same principles as scalable startups, but solutions rather than profits are sought after. They build innovative nonprofits to change the world.

## Winners vs Losers

Losers are those who blindly execute a rigid product management and introduction methodology. They believe all they need is to raise funds for execution of the business strategy that is driven by the founders vision.

Winners are those who combine agile engineering and Customer Development to iteratively build, test, and search for a business model, turning unknowns into knowns.
For winners, they recognize that their startup is a series of untested hypotheses in need of customer proof. You need to gain a deep, personal, firsthand understanding of potential customers' needs before locking into a specific path and precise product specs.

## Customer Development

Customer Development is the process to organize the search for the business model.
The core is: Products developed by founders who get out in front of customers early and often, win.

If you go with the waterfall development process and develop for a year or two without direct and continuous customer contact, **it is unknown whether the features appeal to customers**! Problem is, it can render the product obsolete by the time it launches.

*Search* versus *execution* is what differentiates a new venture from an existing business unit.

## Don't focus on getting to market

Focus instead on understanding *who* you are selling to and *why* they'll buy.
Otherwise, you'll be ignoring situations where you would otherwise think "Our assumption is wrong. I should try something different":

## Financial metrics that matter

- Cash burn rate
- Number of month's worth of cash left in the bank

## To remember

The book keeps saying "They are searching for a repeatable and scalable business model".

## Business Models

Alexander Osterwalder with his book: "Business Model Generation" came in 2010 and was much needed as the de-facto tool to organize startup hypotheses.

**The primary objective of a startup is to validate its business model hypotheses and iterate and pivot until it does**.

Only *then* it moves into *execution mode*. It is at this point the business needs an operating plan, financial forecasts and other well-understood management tools.

The process while searching is first Customer Development and Agile Development and then later, in the execution phase, it is Product Management and Agile or even Waterfall development.

## Processes used to organize and implement the search for the business model

- Customer Development
- Agile Development

## The Customer Development model

Breaks out all customer-related activities of an early-stage company into four easy-to-understand steps:

The Customer Development model *embraces the way startups actually work* (e.g. failure is a good thing - it leads us closer to finding a repeatable and scalable business model).

- *Customer discovery* (a *search activity*): First captures the founders' vision and turns it into a series of business model hypotheses. It now needs to develop a plan to test customer reactions to those hypotheses **to turn them into facts**.
  - Get out of the building and and into conversations with your customers!
  - Two Phases:
		- First, the customer perception of the problem is tested and the customer's need to solve it. It must be important enough to drive significant numbers of customers to buy or engage with the product.
		- Then, the customers will see the product for the first time, assuring that the product (usually a MVP) elegantly solves the problem or filles the need well enough to persuade **lots of customers** to buy.
  - When customers enthusiastically confirm the importance of both the problem and the solution, customer discovery is complete.
  - Pivots may happen. Failure will happen. It is normal and to be expected.

- *Customer validation* (a *search activity*): Tests whether the resulting business model is repeatable and scalable. If not, you return to customer discovery.
  - This is when it is proven that the business model is repeatable and scalable and that it can deliver the volume of customers required to build a profitable company. We want to understand if adding $1 in sales and marketing generate $2+ of revenue/clicks/users/etc.

These two steps refine, corroborate, and test a startup's business model. When complete, the product's core features, the market's and customers existence are validated. The pricing and channel strategies are established, as well as the proposed sales cycle and process. What's neat about those is that we spend as little wasted time and money as possible on building the wrong things only to change them later on. It is only when an adequately sized group of customers and a repeatable sales process that yields a profitable business model are clearly identified and validated that we should move on to the next steps:

- *Customer creation* (an *execution activity*): Start building end-user demand and drive it into the sales channel to scale the business.
  - This is where we step on the gas, spending large sums to scale by creating end-user demand and driving it into the sales channel. Heavy marketing spending will happen. We've learned how to acquire customers.
- *Company-building* (an *execution activity*): Transitions the organization from a startup to a company focused on executing a validated model.
  - We're done being a startup. We're a proper company. So let's build turn it into one. Departments such as Sales, marketing, Business Development, etc, will be established and formalized. Leading a startup require fundamentally different skills than leading a company, so often the founders are outed in favor of an experienced CEO who can scale the business by this point.

## Organization (in Search vs Execution)

- In *Search*, Customer Development reigns. It is Team, Founder-driven.
- In *Execution*, it is instead divided into a - for example - Functional organization by department. E.g. turn into a "real" company.
