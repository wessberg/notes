# Computation expressions

> HR Chapter 12

A *computation expression* of F# provides the means to express a specific kind of computation in a way where low-level details are hidden and only visible through the use of special syntactic constructs like `yield`, `let!`, `return?` etc.

It's called *monads* in other functional languages, and everyone is frightened of them, it seems.

The way I like to look at it is as a container that holds whatever original data you gave and then offers some ways to do stuff with it (like Map, Bind, etc).

Due to examination pressure, I won't delve more into the topic for now.
